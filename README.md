## Key Features:
- Portfolio optimization using mean-variance analysis
- Historical market data fetching via yfinance
- Risk assessment including volatility, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and Value at Risk (VaR)
- Tax efficiency calculations and tax loss harvesting recommendations
- Customizable risk tolerance and tax status settings

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- yfinance
- scikit-learn
- SciPy

## Usage:
1. Clone this repository:
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-portfolio-manager.git
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas yfinance scikit-learn scipy
3. Create an instance of the AdvancedPortfolioManager class:
- manager = AdvancedPortfolioManager(
    initial_capital=10000, 
    risk_tolerance=5, 
    tax_status='standard'
  )

4. Define your investment universe:
investment_universe = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'JNJ', 'PG', 'KO', 'BND', 'AGG', 'VTI', 'SPY']
5. Optimize the portfolio: result = manager.optimize_portfolio(investment_universe)
6.  Access the results:
- print("Portfolio Weights:", result['weights'])
- print("Tax Efficiency Score:", result['tax_efficiency'])
- print("Loss Harvesting Recommendations:", result['loss_harvesting'])
- print("Risk Profile:", result['risk_profile'])

## Customization
- Adjust the `risk_tolerance` parameter to match your investment style
- Modify the `tax_status` to reflect your tax situation ('standard', 'retirement', or 'high_income')
- Expand the `investment_universe` to include additional assets
